How cold is space?,Space is extremely cold, with temperatures close to absolute zero (-273.15°C or -459.67°F). However, the exact temperature depends on the location. For example, in the shadow of a planet or spacecraft, temperatures can drop drastically, while direct sunlight in space can cause temperatures to rise.
Why do astronauts float in space?,Astronauts float in space because they are in a state of free fall, experiencing microgravity. While they are technically still being pulled by Earth's gravity, the spacecraft and the astronauts inside are falling around the Earth at the same rate, creating the sensation of weightlessness.
How do spacecraft travel in space?,Spacecraft travel in space using rockets that provide thrust to overcome Earth's gravity and enter orbit. Once in space, spacecraft can use smaller thrusters for adjustments, relying on Newton’s Third Law of Motion: for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Without air resistance, spacecraft can travel vast distances efficiently.
